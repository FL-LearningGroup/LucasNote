# Proper and short nouns
+ OAuth2.0

+ OpenID Connect

+ AD(Active Directory): is a directory services implementation that provides all sorts of functionality like authentication, group and user management, policy administration and more.

+ LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Is an open and cross platform protocol used for directory services authentication.

+ Kerberos: Authentication is currently the default authorization technology used by Microsoft Windows, and implementations of Kerberos exist in Apple OS, FreeBSD, UNIX, and Linux.

+ SSO: Single-SignOn

+ SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers (SP). 

+ AD FS(Active Directory Federation System): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview

What that jargon means is that you can use one set of credentials to log into many different websites. 
**It’s much simpler to manage one login per user than it is to manage separate logins to email, customer relationship management (CRM) software, Active Directory, etc.**

# LDAP vs. Active Directory
LDAP is a way of speaking to Active Directory.

LDAP is a protocol that many different directory services and access management solutions can understand.

The relationship between AD and LDAP is much like the relationship between Apache and HTTP:

HTTP is a web protocol.

Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol.

LDAP is a directory services protocol.

Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.

Occasionally you’ll hear someone say, “We don’t have Active Directory, but we have LDAP.” What they probably mean is that they have another product, such as OpenLDAP, which is an LDAP server.

It’s kind of like someone saying “We have HTTP” when they really meant “We have an Apache web server.”
