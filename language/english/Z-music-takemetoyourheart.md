Hiding from the rain and snow <br>
Trying to forget, but I won't let go <br>
Looking at a crowded street <br>
Listening to my own heart beat <br>
So many people all around the world <br>
Tell me where do I find someone like you girl <br>
Take me to your heart, take me to your soul <br>
Give me your hand before I'm old <br>
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue <br>
Show me that wonders can be true <br>
They say nothing lasts forever <br>
We're only here today <br>
Love is now or never <br>
Bring me far away <br>
Take me to your heart, take me to your soul <br>
Give me your hand and hold me <br>
Show me what love is, be my guiding star <br>
It's easy take me to your heart <br>
Standing on a mountain high <br>
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky <br>
I should go and see some friends <br>
But they don't really comprehend <br> 
Don't need too much talking without saying anything <br>
All I need is someone who makes me want to sing <br>
Take me to your heart, take me to your soul <br>
Give me your hand before I'm old <br>
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue <br>
Show me that wonders can be true <br>
They say nothing lasts forever <br>
We're only here today <br>
Love is now or never <br>
Bring me far away <br>
Take me to your heart, take me to your soul <br>
Give me your hand and hold me <br>
Show me what love is, be my guiding star <br>
It's easy take me to your heart (take me to, take me to) <br>
Take me to your heart, take me to your soul <br>
Give me your hand and hold me <br>
Show me what love is, be my guiding star <br>
It's easy take me to your heart <br>
