## Think on Abstract, Model, Interface, Class and their relationships.
### Abstract: Why need make object abstract? What is object abstraction?
+ Why: Extract common parts from multiple different kinds of class.Use the common parts construct abstract class.   
       The abstract class cannot be generate because it's not exists.
+ What: Contains common parts from multiple different kinds of class.
### Interface: Why need interface? What is interface?    
+ Why: Includes export function of the class.
+ What: Includes a set of functions that can be called by other classes.
### Model: Why need construct model for object? What is model construccion?
+ Why: Define basic elements that must be implement.
+ What: Includes a set of elements of class.
### Class: Why need class? What is class?
+ Why: Construct object.
+ What: Template of object.
### Object: Why need object? What is object?
+ Why: Represent instance of the real world.
+ What: It is a mapping of real world instances.
