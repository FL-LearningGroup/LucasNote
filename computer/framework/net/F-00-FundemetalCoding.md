## [Attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/attributes/)
### Implementation
The common language runtime allows you to add keyword-like descriptive declarations, called attributes, to annotate programming elements such as **types, fields, methods, and properties**. When you compile your code for the runtime, **it is converted into Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) and placed inside a portable executable (PE) file along with metadata generated by the compiler.** Attributes allow you to place extra descriptive information into metadata that can be extracted using runtime reflection services. The compiler creates attributes when you declare instances of special classes that **derive from System.Attribute**.
