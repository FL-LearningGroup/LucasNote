# Concurrency
并发，应用在同一个时间超过了一个任务
Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than one task at the same time.
Concurrency means executing multiple tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously.
# Paralle
并行，将同一个任务拆分成多个任务
Parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple CPUs at the exact same time.  
At the same time, the two tasks are really executed simultaneously, and it’s called parallel.
